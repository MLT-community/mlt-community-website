## Medical Laboratory Community of Practice

Is there a need for a Community of Practice in the Medical Laboratory Profession?

To answer this question, we need your help and input. A team of researchers and practitioners lead by Brenda Gamble and Lavern Bourne at Ontario Tech University have developed a survey to determine the views on a Medical Laboratory Profession community of practice. The survey was developed based on feedback from a workshop, held in October 2022 and was attended by medical laboratory professional stakeholders from across Canada.


## Join This Study
We invite you to participate in this survey which will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
