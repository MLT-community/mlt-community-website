## The Role of Interprofessional Education for Medical Laboratory Professionals

The need to provide quality health care is a priority in Canada. Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) supports this priority. Within the medical laboratory sector, the delivery of quality services is dependent upon the collaboration of professionals inside (i.e., MLT and MLAT) and outside (i.e., physicians, and epidemiologists). The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the need for medical laboratory professionals who can work collaboratively with public health professionals who provide clinical care to address the health needs of Canadians. The learning activities of this session are designed to create an awareness of the importance of IPC and to direct the audience to resources that are available including the creation of knowledge through a virtual learning environment that facilitates a work-integrated learning (WIL) experience.
